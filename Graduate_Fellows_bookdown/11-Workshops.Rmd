## Confirming Dates with Instructors

Subject: QCL Workshops - confirming dates

Good afternoon Bhaven,  

Happy Tuesday! I hope you are doing well! As the new semester approaches, I wanted to confirm if these dates work for you to instruct:  

Monday, January 24, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with LaTeX as an online workshop  

Monday, February 21, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with MATLAB (TBA as a hybrid, in-person, or online workshop due to the Covid policies)    

We have only scheduled up to Spring Break, I will have to follow up in the future for the rest of the semester's dates. Do these dates and time work for you to instruct the workshops?

_Data Wrangling with R (Level 2 - Data)_

Summary:  
Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. So it's essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse.

Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)  
Import and export data
Clean, reshape and transform data
Make messy data into tidy data
Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits)

Prerequisites:  
Basic knowledge of R and RStudio (e.g., R Programming for Beginners - Level 1)
RStudio Cloud account; if you don't have one yet, please create a new account from https://rstudio.cloud site.

_GIS - Part 2 (Level 1 - Data) Workshop_

About this Event

Summary:  
This workshop will introduce you to the ever-expanding and fascinating world of geographic information systems (GIS). In three 2-hour sessions you will learn about what GIS is, how it is used in a multitude of industries and fields, and how to get started using GIS software. We will examine GIS concepts and software tools used to visualize real-world features, discover patterns, and communicate information. Primarily using ArcGIS Online (if you can hyperlink: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/what-is-agol.htm) you will work with GIS maps, explore data, and analyze maps and data as you learn fundamental concepts that underlie GIS technology.
Through a series of presentations, in-class tutorials, and homework assignments this workshop will give you a strong beginning foundation on how to make maps and explore spatial data to identify patterns and insights in your data you never knew possible. You will come away from this workshop with the understanding you need to start working with GIS and utilize it in your own work and explorations. You do not need any previous experience – just your own curiosity! 
Students in this workshop (in fact, all Claremont Colleges students) have free access to a wide variety Esri GIS products. For more information, check out the Claremont Colleges Library Geographic Information System (GIS) Services home page, https://library.claremont.edu/gis/

Dear MATLAB (Level 1 – Coding+Computing) Attendees:  
 
Thank you for registering for the MATLAB (Level 1 – Coding+Computing) Workshop.

Getting Equipped with MATLAB (Level 1 – Coding+Computing)  

Instructor: Bhaven Mistry (Assistant Director of the QCL)

Summary:    
Want to learn to program, but don’t know where to start or what to install? MATLAB is a numerical computing language and environment that is surprisingly easy to use. Typically used by engineers and scientists, you can think of it as a very powerful, customizable calculator. But, interestingly, it’s this very characteristic that makes MATLAB an ideal language for programming beginners, even if you’re not mathematically inclined.
In this workshop, we will step you through the basics of programming using the MATLAB coding environment. We will start by getting familiar with the software, learning the basics of variable assignment and manipulation, writing our own functions, and exploring some applications. If you’re completely new to programming, learning the fundamentals with MATLAB first is a great way to springboard into other languages. Alternatively, if you have some experience with programming, but have always wanted to learn what MATLAB is used for, this could be a good way to get your feet wet.

Pre-requisites:  
Internet Use: Introductory level (search, log-in, navigation of websites, etc.)
Software: Attendees are asked to have MATLAB on their computers for the workshop. MATLAB is available for CMC students and faculty at https://www.cmc.edu/information-technology/academic-software

Location:  
Online (Attendees will receive the Zoom meeting information after registration)

Participants:  

Open to all CMC Students, Faculty and Staff

I am attaching information for the workshop below:

## Workshops Building

*	In the past, the way we offer our workshop to specific institute like Lowe was that we (Cindy) worked with their admin or student leader to find good times for their fellows and RAs and offer a separate workshop(s) for them. I am thinking we would want to offer them a separate GIS workshop(s).

## Zoom Recording Downloads

We are reaching out today with a friendly and important reminder to please transfer or delete your older Zoom cloud recordings within your Zoom account to help ensure that we can continue to provide this service to our faculty and staff without accruing additional storage expenses.

Our Zoom cloud recording storage currently has a shared quota of 1 terabyte for all users and about 1 gigabyte of storage per individual user. However, we now have several Zoom accounts that are way over the 1 gigabyte storage allotment. To collectively help save space, we recommend that all users download their Zoom recordings and store them in an alternate location, such as Box where much more storage space is available. Once you’ve stored the recordings in an alternate location, please make sure to go back and delete the recordings from your Zoom cloud storage.

Action Needed:

*	If you use Zoom cloud recording – please follow the below instructions for offloading your recordings and then delete them off Zoom once transferred

_How to Download Your Zoom Cloud Recordings:_

1. Login to the Zoom.us web portal (https://zoom.us) 

2. In the left-hand navigation menu, click Recordings (direct link: https://zoom.us/recording)

3. Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download

![Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMC-QCL/fellow-handbook/main/Images/Recording1.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQHYZSE62MPXWLO7RAVXLT2YR37G7Q)

4. Click Download on the pop-up that appears

![Click Download on the pop-up that appears](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMC-QCL/fellow-handbook/main/Images/Recording2.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQHYZSEDGFDZMEIKP7HMG7SYR37HBA)

5. Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files.

![Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMC-QCL/fellow-handbook/main/Images/Recording3.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQHYZSEFR6W6JMYF4LAP262YR37HCA)

6. Check your Downloads folder for your recording files (.m4a for audio and .mp4 for video)

Once downloaded, you can upload your files to your Box account (https://claremontmckenna.box.com). Box has a very large storage capacity per user and can be increased when necessary.

Once your files are on Box or stored somewhere safe off Zoom, you can share your files with others using the instructions outlined in the attached PDF guide called “Sharing Files in Box”.

Alternatively, if you’d like to use local recording instead with Zoom, we have attached guides for this as well.  However, we only recommend this for non-critical events and for use outside of the classroom setting.
