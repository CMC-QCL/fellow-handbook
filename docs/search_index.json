The QCL supports the integration of computer and data science into the full range of liberal arts disciplines: the social sciences, sciences, and humanities, helping students apply quantitative literacy to any discipline, from economics to government, from biology to philosophy. Our staff provides one-on-one support and tutoring so students can learn how to incorporate quantitative and computing skills into research papers or other academic projects, as often requested by professors. We also help students understand the programming languages so its less intimidating and show them where to find the best sources of support information to elevate the quality and clarity of their analyses. Given modern workforce requirementswhere data has infused itself in everything from political analysis and business dynamics to sports analyticsQCL aims to make data and quantitative skills accessible to students from all backgrounds, including those traditionally underrepresented in quantitative and technology fields. Last time, I asked: What does mathematics mean to you? And some people answered: The manipulation of numbers, the manipulation of structures. And if I had asked what music means to you, would you have answered: The manipulation of notes?

R is widely used in industry as well as in academia for statistical analysis and data visualization. In this workshop, we introduce the basics of the R language and its programming environment through simple hands-on examples. This workshop is designed for beginners in R programming, so no prior knowledge of R programming is needed. However, general programming knowledge in any programming language will be help understand the programming concepts. We will be using RStudio Cloud for hands-on. Please create a free account at https://rstudio.cloud before join the workshop. Agenda:  Basics of R and RStudio  R Programming Environment: Workspace, Working Directory, Package  R objects (data structure and function)  R packages for data import and export  R graphics for simple plotting methods  Basic statistical analysis using R Location: Hybrid (In-person: QCL Classroom, Online: Zoom information will be provided to the attendees after registration) Click here to find your way to the QCL. Participants: CMC Students, Faculty, and Staff ___ Data Wrangling with R (Level 2 - Data) Summary: Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. So its essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse. Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to) Import and export data Clean, reshape and transform data Make messy data into tidy data Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits) Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of R and RStudio (e.g., R Programming for Beginners - Level 1) RStudio Cloud account; if you dont have one yet, please create a new account from https://rstudio.cloud site.

Getting Equipped with MATLAB (Level 1  Coding+Computing) Instructor: Bhaven Mistry (Assistant Director of the QCL) Summary: Want to learn to program, but dont know where to start or what to install? MATLAB is a numerical computing language and environment that is surprisingly easy to use. Typically used by engineers and scientists, you can think of it as a very powerful, customizable calculator. But, interestingly, its this very characteristic that makes MATLAB an ideal language for programming beginners, even if youre not mathematically inclined. In this workshop, we will step you through the basics of programming using the MATLAB coding environment. We will start by getting familiar with the software, learning the basics of variable assignment and manipulation, writing our own functions, and exploring some applications. If youre completely new to programming, learning the fundamentals with MATLAB first is a great way to springboard into other languages. Alternatively, if you have some experience with programming, but have always wanted to learn what MATLAB is used for, this could be a good way to get your feet wet. Pre-requisites: Internet Use: Introductory level (search, log-in, navigation of websites, etc.) Software: Attendees are asked to have MATLAB on their computers for the workshop. MATLAB is available for CMC students and faculty at https://www.cmc.edu/information-technology/academic-software Location: Online (Attendees will receive the Zoom meeting information after registration) Participants: Open to all CMC Students, Faculty and Staff I am attaching information for the workshop below: QCL Workshop is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.

Our Zoom cloud recording storage currently has a shared quota of 1 terabyte for all users and about 1 gigabyte of storage per individual user. However, we now have several Zoom accounts that are way over the 1 gigabyte storage allotment. To collectively help save space, we recommend that all users download their Zoom recordings and store them in an alternate location, such as Box where much more storage space is available. Once youve stored the recordings in an alternate location, please make sure to go back and delete the recordings from your Zoom cloud storage. Action Needed: If you use Zoom cloud recording  please follow the below instructions for offloading your recordings and then delete them off Zoom once transferred How to Download Your Zoom Cloud Recordings: Login to the Zoom.us web portal (https://zoom.us) In the left-hand navigation menu, click Recordings (direct link: https://zoom.us/recording) Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download Click Download on the pop-up that appears Click Download on the pop-up that appears Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files. Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files. Check your Downloads folder for your recording files (.m4a for audio and .mp4 for video) Once downloaded, you can upload your files to your Box account (https://claremontmckenna.box.com). Box has a very large storage capacity per user and can be increased when necessary. Once your files are on Box or stored somewhere safe off Zoom, you can share your files with others using the instructions outlined in the attached PDF guide called Sharing Files in Box. Alternatively, if youd like to use local recording instead with Zoom, we have attached guides for this as well. However, we only recommend this for non-critical events and for use outside of the classroom setting. pic20 pic21 pic22 pic23 pic24 pic25 pic26 pic27 12.11 Qualtrics Make a Workflow Sign-in Survey qual1 qual2 qual3 qual4 qual5 qual6 qual7 qual8 qual9 qual10 qual11 qual12 qual13 qual14 qual15 qual16 Exit Survey qual17 qual18 qual19 qual20 qual21 qual22 qual23 qual24 qual25 qual26 qual27 qual28 12.12 How to schedule meetings on Zoom meeting1 meeting2 "],["qcl-impact-report.html", "Section 13 QCL Impact Report 13.1 Qualtrics  Reports 13.2 Localist  Reports 13.3 Summaries 13.4 Rough Draft Impact Report", " Section 13 QCL Impact Report impact1 13.1 Qualtrics  Reports ReportsQ1 ReportsQ2 ReportsQ3 ReportsQ4 ReportsQ5 ReportsQ6 ReportsQ7 ReportsQ8 ReportsQ9 13.2 Localist  Reports ReportsL1 ReportsL2 ReportsL3 ReportsL4 ReportsL5 ReportsL6 ReportsL7 ReportsL8 13.3 Summaries summaries1 Missing Data missing1 Localist SumL1 Need to get Event Name and Event ID from site and manually input it in sumL2 Qualtrics sumQ1 Exit sumq2 sumq3 Sign in sumq4 sumq5 13.4 Rough Draft Impact Report Rough1 Rough2 Rough3 Rough4 Rough5 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
