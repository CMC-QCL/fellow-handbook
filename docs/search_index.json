Our staff provides one-on-one support and tutoring so students can learn how to incorporate quantitative and computing skills into research papers or other academic projects, as often requested by professors. We also help students understand the programming languages so it’s less intimidating and show them where to find the best sources of support information to elevate the quality and clarity of their analyses. Given modern workforce requirements—where data has infused itself in everything from political analysis and business dynamics to sports analytics—QCL aims to make data and quantitative skills accessible to students from all backgrounds, including those traditionally underrepresented in quantitative and technology fields.

Thank you, Graduate Fellow - Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab (QCL) Example Instructors Notes turned into Summaries [QCL Workshop] R Programming Basics (Level 1 – Coding) About this Event R Programming Basics (Level 1 - Coding) Summary: R is an open-source statistical programming language. R is widely used in industry as well as in academia for statistical analysis and data visualization. In this workshop, we introduce the basics of the R language and its programming environment through simple hands-on examples. This workshop is designed for beginners in R programming, so no prior knowledge of R programming is needed. However, general programming knowledge in any programming language will be help understand the programming concepts. We will be using RStudio Cloud for hands-on. Please create a free account at https://rstudio.cloud before join the workshop. Agenda: • Basics of R and RStudio • R Programming Environment: Workspace, Working Directory, Package • R objects (data structure and function) • R packages for data import and export • R graphics for simple plotting methods • Basic statistical analysis using R Location: Hybrid (In-person: QCL Classroom, Online: Zoom information will be provided to the attendees after registration) Click here to find your way to the QCL. Participants: CMC Students, Faculty, and Staff Data Wrangling with R (Level 2 - Data) Summary: Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. So it’s essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse. Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to) Import and export data Clean, reshape and transform data Make messy data into tidy data Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits) Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of R and RStudio (e.g., R Programming for Beginners - Level 1) RStudio Cloud account; if you don’t have one yet, please create a new account from https://rstudio.cloud site. Tidyverse package; please make sure that you have installed the tidyverse package in your R environment. See https://www.tidyverse.org for more information.

Participants: CMC Students, Faculty, and Staff GIS - Part 2 (Level 1 - Data) Workshop About this Event Summary: This workshop will introduce you to the ever-expanding and fascinating world of geographic information systems (GIS). In three 2-hour sessions you will learn about what GIS is, how it is used in a multitude of industries and fields, and how to get started using GIS software. We will examine GIS concepts and software tools used to visualize real-world features, discover patterns, and communicate information. Primarily using ArcGIS Online (if you can hyperlink: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/what-is-agol.htm) you will work with GIS maps, explore data, and analyze maps and data as you learn fundamental concepts that underlie GIS technology. Through a series of presentations, in-class tutorials, and homework assignments this workshop will give you a strong beginning foundation on how to make maps and explore spatial data to identify patterns and insights in your data you never knew possible. You will come away from this workshop with the understanding you need to start working with GIS and utilize it in your own work and explorations. You do not need any previous experience – just your own curiosity! Students in this workshop (in fact, all Claremont Colleges students) have free access to a wide variety Esri GIS products.

Our Zoom cloud recording storage currently has a shared quota of 1 terabyte for all users and about 1 gigabyte of storage per individual user. However, we now have several Zoom accounts that are way over the 1 gigabyte storage allotment. To collectively help save space, we recommend that all users download their Zoom recordings and store them in an alternate location, such as Box where much more storage space is available. Once you’ve stored the recordings in an alternate location, please make sure to go back and delete the recordings from your Zoom cloud storage.” Action Needed: If you use Zoom cloud recording – please follow the below instructions for offloading your recordings and then delete them off Zoom once transferred How to Download Your Zoom Cloud Recordings: Login to the Zoom.us web portal (https://zoom.us) In the left-hand navigation menu, click Recordings (direct link: https://zoom.us/recording) Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download Click Download on the pop-up that appears Click Download on the pop-up that appears Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files. Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files. Check your Downloads folder for your recording files (.m4a for audio and .mp4 for video) Once downloaded, you can upload your files to your Box account (https://claremontmckenna.box.com). Box has a very large storage capacity per user and can be increased when necessary. Once your files are on Box or stored somewhere safe off Zoom, you can share your files with others using the instructions outlined in the attached PDF guide called “Sharing Files in Box”. Alternatively, if you’d like to use local recording instead with Zoom, we have attached guides for this as well. However, we only recommend this for non-critical events and for use outside of the classroom setting.
