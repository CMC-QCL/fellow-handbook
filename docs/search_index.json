Our staff provides one-on-one support and tutoring so students can learn how to incorporate quantitative and computing skills into research papers or other academic projects, as often requested by professors. We also help students understand the programming languages so it’s less intimidating and show them where to find the best sources of support information to elevate the quality and clarity of their analyses. Given modern workforce requirements—where data has infused itself in everything from political analysis and business dynamics to sports analytics—QCL aims to make data and quantitative skills accessible to students from all backgrounds, including those traditionally underrepresented in quantitative and technology fields. Last time, I asked: “What does mathematics mean to you?” And some people answered: “The manipulation of numbers, the manipulation of structures.” And if I had asked what music means to you, would you have answered: “The manipulation of notes?” —Serge Lang 2.1 Dress code Office Casual slacks and a nice shirt 2.2 Materials needed Computer (laptop) Printer Cord to print out papers from the printer 2.3 New Employee Sign On Before Resume and Cover Letter and References Interview Acceptance After HR email Orientation Workday IT will send you an email https://www.myworkday.com/theclaremontcolleges/d/home.htmld Signed documents Contract Show U.S. Citizenship/VISA Get temporary permit for parking Park in CMC permit parking or on the street (no permit needed) On-Board Meeting Talk about Schedule Shadow a workshop Employee Materials Download Software Make Accounts Go Over Fellow Handbook 2.4 Campus Map "],["employee-materials.html", "Section 3 Employee Materials 3.1 Accounts and Software 3.2 Logins and Passwords 3.3 Schedule", " Section 3 Employee Materials Employee ID Go to Connects in The Claremont Colleges Library Honnold Mudd (H on map) Take picture Receive ID Go to Story House (14 on map) Get access to infrastructure (doors) Also need a KEY for office room Email and Username Setup appointment for IT (Jeff) help@cmc.edu Obtain computer access Get put into system Kronos Send email to Payroll payroll@cmc.edu Find Kronos in Workday Log in hours Talk to Program Assistant Health Documents https://www.cmc.edu/healthscreen Training with EVERFI Hazard Communication (CA) Protecting Youth Preventing Harassment and Discrimination: Non-Supervisors Injury &amp;

Participants: CMC Students, Faculty, and Staff Data Wrangling with R (Level 2 - Data) Summary: Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. So it’s essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse. Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to) Import and export data Clean, reshape and transform data Make messy data into tidy data Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits) Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of R and RStudio (e.g., R Programming for Beginners - Level 1) RStudio Cloud account; if you don’t have one yet, please create a new account from https://rstudio.cloud site. Tidyverse package; please make sure that you have installed the tidyverse package in your R environment. See https://www.tidyverse.org for more information.

Our Zoom cloud recording storage currently has a shared quota of 1 terabyte for all users and about 1 gigabyte of storage per individual user. However, we now have several Zoom accounts that are way over the 1 gigabyte storage allotment. To collectively help save space, we recommend that all users download their Zoom recordings and store them in an alternate location, such as Box where much more storage space is available. Once you’ve stored the recordings in an alternate location, please make sure to go back and delete the recordings from your Zoom cloud storage. Action Needed: If you use Zoom cloud recording – please follow the below instructions for offloading your recordings and then delete them off Zoom once transferred How to Download Your Zoom Cloud Recordings: Login to the Zoom.us web portal (https://zoom.us) In the left-hand navigation menu, click Recordings (direct link: https://zoom.us/recording) Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download Click More next to a meeting recording and click Download Click Download on the pop-up that appears Click Download on the pop-up that appears Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files. Click Allow if prompted for permission to Download multiple files. Check your Downloads folder for your recording files (.m4a for audio and .mp4 for video) Once downloaded, you can upload your files to your Box account (https://claremontmckenna.box.com). Box has a very large storage capacity per user and can be increased when necessary. Once your files are on Box or stored somewhere safe off Zoom, you can share your files with others using the instructions outlined in the attached PDF guide called “Sharing Files in Box”. Alternatively, if you’d like to use local recording instead with Zoom, we have attached guides for this as well. However, we only recommend this for non-critical events and for use outside of the classroom setting. ___ 5.10 Qualtrics Make a Workflow (outdated need new pictures) Sign-in Survey Exit Survey 5.11 How to schedule meetings on Zoom "],["qcl-impact-report.html", "Section 6 QCL Impact Report 6.1 Qualtrics – Reports 6.2 Localist – Reports 6.3 Summaries 6.4 Rough Draft Impact Report", " Section 6 QCL Impact Report ___ 6.1 Qualtrics – Reports 6.2 Localist – Reports 6.3 Summaries Missing Data Localist Need to get Event Name and Event ID from site and manually input it in Qualtrics Exit Sign in 6.4 Rough Draft Impact Report "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
