Good afternoon Bhaven,  

Happy Tuesday! I hope you are doing well! As the new semester approaches, I wanted to confirm if these dates work for you to instruct:  

Monday, January 24, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with LaTeX as an online workshop  

Monday, February 21, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with MATLAB (TBA as a hybrid, in-person, or online workshop due to the Covid policies)    

We have only scheduled up to Spring Break, I will have to follow up in the future for the rest of the semester's dates. Do these dates and time work for you to instruct the workshops?

_Data Wrangling with R (Level 2 - Data)_

Summary:  
Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. So it's essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse.

Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)  
Import and export data
Clean, reshape and transform data
Make messy data into tidy data
Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits)

Prerequisites:  
Basic knowledge of R and RStudio (e.g., R Programming for Beginners - Level 1)
RStudio Cloud account; if you don't have one yet, please create a new account from https://rstudio.cloud site.
Tidyverse package; please make sure that you have installed the tidyverse package in your R environment. See https://www.tidyverse.org for more information.

_GIS - Part 2 (Level 1 - Data) Workshop_

About this Event

Summary:  
This workshop will introduce you to the ever-expanding and fascinating world of geographic information systems (GIS). In three 2-hour sessions you will learn about what GIS is, how it is used in a multitude of industries and fields, and how to get started using GIS software. We will examine GIS concepts and software tools used to visualize real-world features, discover patterns, and communicate information. Primarily using ArcGIS Online (if you can hyperlink: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/what-is-agol.htm) you will work with GIS maps, explore data, and analyze maps and data as you learn fundamental concepts that underlie GIS technology.
Through a series of presentations, in-class tutorials, and homework assignments this workshop will give you a strong beginning foundation on how to make maps and explore spatial data to identify patterns and insights in your data you never knew possible. You will come away from this workshop with the understanding you need to start working with GIS and utilize it in your own work and explorations. You do not need any previous experience – just your own curiosity! 
Students in this workshop (in fact, all Claremont Colleges students) have free access to a wide variety Esri GIS products. For more information, check out the Claremont Colleges Library Geographic Information System (GIS) Services home page, https://library.claremont.edu/gis/ 

Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)  
Topics will include: 
•	Introduction to the GIS Platform 
•	Theoretical basis of GIS and the Geographic Approach 
•	What can you do with GIS? 
•	Understanding GIS data 
•	An introduction to Coordinate systems and Projections 
•	Acquiring and selecting GIS Data 
•	Utilizing and preparing your own data for GIS 
•	Creating maps – basic cartography, symbology 
•	The US Census and GIS 
•	Introductory Spatial Analysis 
•	Sharing results – physical maps and the world online maps 

Location:  
The following event will be conducted in a hybrid format:
•	Virtual: Zoom

Dear MATLAB (Level 1 – Coding+Computing) Attendees:  
 
Thank you for registering for the MATLAB (Level 1 – Coding+Computing) Workshop.

Getting Equipped with MATLAB (Level 1 – Coding+Computing)

Instructor: Bhaven Mistry (Assistant Director of the QCL)

Summary
Want to learn to program, but don’t know where to start or what to install? MATLAB is a numerical computing language and environment that is surprisingly easy to use. Typically used by engineers and scientists, you can think of it as a very powerful, customizable calculator. But, interestingly, it’s this very characteristic that makes MATLAB an ideal language for programming beginners, even if you’re not mathematically inclined.
In this workshop, we will step you through the basics of programming using the MATLAB coding environment. We will start by getting familiar with the software, learning the basics of variable assignment and manipulation, writing our own functions, and exploring some applications. If you’re completely new to programming, learning the fundamentals with MATLAB first is a great way to springboard into other languages. Alternatively, if you have some experience with programming, but have always wanted to learn what MATLAB is used for, this could be a good way to get your feet wet.

Pre-requisites:
Internet Use: Introductory level (search, log-in, navigation of websites, etc.)
Software: Attendees are asked to have MATLAB on their computers for the workshop. MATLAB is available for CMC students and faculty at https://www.cmc.edu/information-technology/academic-software

Location
Online (Attendees will receive the Zoom meeting information after registration)

Participants

Open to all CMC Students, Faculty and Staff
