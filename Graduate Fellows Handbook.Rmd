Good afternoon Bhaven,  

Happy Tuesday! I hope you are doing well! As the new semester approaches, I wanted to confirm if these dates work for you to instruct:  

Monday, January 24, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with LaTeX as an online workshop  

Monday, February 21, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with MATLAB (TBA as a hybrid, in-person, or online workshop due to the Covid policies)    

We have only scheduled up to Spring Break, I will have to follow up in the future for the rest of the semester's dates. Do these dates and time work for you to instruct the workshops?

Second, do you have any pre-workshop requirements that the attendees need to do before the workshop? Like download programs or sign up for a license.    
Third, what time did you want to do your workshop at 3pm-5pm or 4pm-6pm?  
Fourth, would you like this workshop to be a hybrid, online only or in-person only?  
Lastly, is there any information you would like me to let the attendees know about before walking into the workshop? like website where to download files or a note about the data.  
Thank you for this information, it will help me in getting the workshop's registration ready.  

Thank you,

_Data Wrangling with R (Level 2 - Data)_

Summary:  
Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. So it's essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse.

Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)  
Import and export data
Clean, reshape and transform data
Make messy data into tidy data
Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits)

Prerequisites:  
Basic knowledge of R and RStudio (e.g., R Programming for Beginners - Level 1)
RStudio Cloud account; if you don't have one yet, please create a new account from https://rstudio.cloud site.
Tidyverse package; please make sure that you have installed the tidyverse package in your R environment. See https://www.tidyverse.org for more information.

_GIS - Part 2 (Level 1 - Data) Workshop_

About this Event

Summary:  
This workshop will introduce you to the ever-expanding and fascinating world of geographic information systems (GIS). In three 2-hour sessions you will learn about what GIS is, how it is used in a multitude of industries and fields, and how to get started using GIS software. We will examine GIS concepts and software tools used to visualize real-world features, discover patterns, and communicate information. Primarily using ArcGIS Online (if you can hyperlink: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/what-is-agol.htm) you will work with GIS maps, explore data, and analyze maps and data as you learn fundamental concepts that underlie GIS technology.
Through a series of presentations, in-class tutorials, and homework assignments this workshop will give you a strong beginning foundation on how to make maps and explore spatial data to identify patterns and insights in your data you never knew possible. You will come away from this workshop with the understanding you need to start working with GIS and utilize it in your own work and explorations. You do not need any previous experience – just your own curiosity! 
Students in this workshop (in fact, all Claremont Colleges students) have free access to a wide variety Esri GIS products. For more information, check out the Claremont Colleges Library Geographic Information System (GIS) Services home page, https://library.claremont.edu/gis/ 

Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)  
Topics will include: 
•	Introduction to the GIS Platform 
•	Theoretical basis of GIS and the Geographic Approach 
•	What can you do with GIS? 
•	Understanding GIS data 
•	An introduction to Coordinate systems and Projections 
•	Acquiring and selecting GIS Data 
•	Utilizing and preparing your own data for GIS 
•	Creating maps – basic cartography, symbology 
•	The US Census and GIS 
•	Introductory Spatial Analysis 
•	Sharing results – physical maps and the world online maps 

Location:  
The following event will be conducted in a hybrid format:
•	Virtual: Zoom
