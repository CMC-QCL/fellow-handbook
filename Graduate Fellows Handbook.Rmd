Subject: QCL Workshops - confirming dates

Good afternoon Bhaven,  

Happy Tuesday! I hope you are doing well! As the new semester approaches, I wanted to confirm if these dates work for you to instruct:  

Monday, January 24, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with LaTeX as an online workshop  

Monday, February 21, 2022, at 5pm - 7pm for Get Equipped with MATLAB (TBA as a hybrid, in-person, or online workshop due to the Covid policies)    

We have only scheduled up to Spring Break, I will have to follow up in the future for the rest of the semester's dates. Do these dates and time work for you to instruct the workshops?

Thank you,

Good afternoon [instructor’s name],  

Happy Tuesday! I am looking forward to your dryrun of [workshop]! I am starting to create the registration page for the workshop and would like to get a bit of information from you about the workshop.   

First, do you have a summary page for your workshop? I have an example of Sam Lee's below:   

photo5   

Second, do you have any pre-workshop requirements that the attendees need to do before the workshop? Like download programs or sign up for a license.  

Third, what time did you want to do your workshop at 3pm-5pm or 4pm-6pm?  
Fourth, would you like this workshop to be a hybrid, online only or in-person only?  
Lastly, is there any information you would like me to let the attendees know about before walking into the workshop? like website where to download files or a note about the data.  
Thank you for this information, it will help me in getting the workshop's registration ready.  

Thank you,  
Graduate Fellow - Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab (QCL)
